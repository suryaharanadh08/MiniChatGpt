# Local ChatGPT-like Webpage

## Project Overview

I'm B. Suryaharanadh, a BTech final year student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I developed a simple, interactive webpage akin to ChatGPT that can be hosted locally. This project leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT (version 3.5) to provide responses based on user queries, mimicking ChatGPT's functionality.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ChatGPT model.
- **Local Hosting**: Can be hosted locally on your machine for personal use.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Utilizes the ChatGPT (version 3.5) API to generate responses based on user inputs.
